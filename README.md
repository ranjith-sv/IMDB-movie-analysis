IMDB-MOVIE DATASET

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema. This website contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more. Faced with the large amount of data available on this site, I thought that it would be interesting to analyze the movies data on the IMDb website between the year 2000 and the year 2017.
We find the selected data: Movie title -> Movie Genre of the movie -> Genre Movie duration (in minutes) -> timeMin Release year of the film -> Year Number of public votes -> Vote Public rating (score out of 10) -> audienceRating Critics rating (score out of 100) -> criticRating Movie Gross (in millions of dollars) -> grossMillions
